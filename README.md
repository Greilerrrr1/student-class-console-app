# Student Class Console Application (C#)

A C# console application demonstrating object-oriented programming concepts
through a `Student` class and a test driver program.

This project focuses on constructors, properties with validation, encapsulation,
methods, arrays of objects, and formatted output using `ToString()`.

---

## Features

- Custom `Student` class with:
  - Name
  - GPA (validated between 0.0–4.0)
  - Credit hours (validated between 0–18)
  - Classification
  - Major
  - Enrollment status
- Constructor-based object initialization
- Property validation with default values
- Enrollment control via `Enroll()` and `Unenroll()` methods
- Overridden `ToString()` method for formatted output
- Console-based test application
- Array of `Student` objects
- Pre- and post-modification output display

## Technologies Used

- C#
- .NET
- Console Application
- Visual Studio

## How the Program Works

1. Five `Student` objects are created and stored in an array
2. Initial student data is printed to the console
3. Selected student properties are modified
4. Enrollment status is changed using class methods
5. Updated student data is printed again to show changes

## Concepts Demonstrated

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Encapsulation
- Constructors and properties
- Validation logic
- Arrays of objects
- Method reuse
- Clean console output formatting
